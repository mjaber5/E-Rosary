E-Rosary: A Modern Spiritual Companion
E-Rosary is a mobile application designed to help users track their daily spiritual practices, specifically through reciting key Islamic phrases. The app uses voice recognition technology to listen for specific phrases, incrementing a counter each time they are spoken. This app combines spirituality with modern technology to provide a seamless, interactive experience for daily devotion.

Features
Voice Recognition: Detects specific phrases like "Subhanallah", "Allahu Akbar", and "Alhamdulillah", and automatically increments a recitation counter.

Personalized Progress Tracking: Tracks user recitations and displays the number of times phrases are repeated, providing an easy way to monitor progress.

Multilingual Support: Available in both English and Arabic to cater to a wider audience.

Firebase Integration: Uses Firebase Authentication for secure user login and Firestore for saving and syncing recitation data across devices.

Offline Functionality: Users can continue reciting even without an internet connection. Data will sync with Firebase once the user is online.

User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design with a floating action button for easy activation of voice recognition and real-time feedback on recognized speech.

Customizable Appearance: Glowing animation on the microphone button to indicate when the app is actively listening.

Flutter: Version 3.x and above
Dart: Version 2.x and above
Firebase Account: To set up authentication and Firestore storage

Usage
